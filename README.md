# IPL Data (Exploratory Analysis)
The dataset containing the data of IPL matches (from 2008 to 2017) is cleaned using python.

Then, we performed exploratory data analysis to get some meaningful insights.

We also prepared the Batsman and Bowler dahboards using Tableau (.twbx file is also added here).
